**WireMock Spring Boot** library drastically simplifies WireMock configuration in a **Spring Boot** and **JUnit 5** application.

See the [WireMock Spring Boot doc page](https://wiremock.org/docs/spring-boot/) for installation and usage details. There are also [running examples of use cases](https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock-spring-boot/tree/main/src/test/java/usecases).

## Highlights

* Fully declarative [WireMock](https://wiremock.org/) setup
* Support for **multiple** `WireMockServer` **instances** - one per HTTP client as recommended in the WireMock documentation
* Automatically sets Spring environment properties
* Does not pollute Spring application context with extra beans
